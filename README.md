## How to run our project:
1. Make sure to pip install numpy
2. In the 'puzzles.txt' enter the puzzles boards in a string format:
    - board_size max_d max_l      board of 1 and 0
    - ex:  4 9 50 111010011100011
    - multiple boards can be entered in the same text file
3. To run thecode cd into the correct folder and enter the following line:
    > python3 run.py
4. The output will be displayed in 2 separate files per board:
    - if 2 boards were entered in the 'puzzles.txt' the output files would be:
    - 0_dfs_search.txt  0_dfs_solution.txt  1_dfs_search.txt    1_dfs_solution.txt
